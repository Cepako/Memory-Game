# Memory-Game

Memory Game is a simple card game where players have to find pairs of identical cards. The game consists of 16 cards, divided into 8 pairs. The cards are randomly placed on the board face down. Players flip two cards. If the cards form a pair, they are revealed.
If the cards do not form a pair, they are turned face down again. The game ends when all cards are revealed.
